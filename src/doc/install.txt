TeamCal Pro Installation
==============================================================================

Installation
============
Installing TeamCal Pro has been made much easier since version 3.0. An 
installation script takes away the hassle of manually editing files to set up 
your individual environment. The recommended basic installation steps are:

1) Unpack the TeamCal Pro archive to your local hard drive

2) Copy the TeamCal Pro directories including all sub directories and files to 
   the desired location at your web space.
   Note: The 'doc' folder is not necessary to run TeamCal Pro.

3) Direct your browser to the location of your TeamCal Pro. The installation 
   page will show.

4) Enter all information as requested and click [Install]

5) Delete the file "installation.php"

That does not sound too difficult, does it?

The default administration account after installation is:
User ID: admin
Password: root

Make sure you change that password after first login.

===========================================

Header
------
includes/header_app_inc.php
You can adjust your own page header if you like to show a different logo or
image on top of the main TeamCal page.

Style
-----
There are three themes shipped with TeamCal Pro, "tcpro", "deviant" and 
"metro". You can create your own theme by copying one of those directories 
in the theme folder and name it as you like. Then make your changes to your 
new theme files. TeamCal Pro will automatically detect that new theme folder 
and offer it as a theme selection in the configuration page.

Languages
---------
TeamCal Pro supports different language packages. The distribution comes with 
an English and German language file. You are free to add more languages 
which is a fairly easy process.

Make a copy of includes/lang/english.tcpro.php and name it according to the 
language you are preparing, e.g. portugese.tcpro.php . Open your new language 
file and change the English text values to Portugese. Make sure your not 
touching any of the PHP code around it. Also there are some strings beginning 
or ending with blanks. These blanks are used on purpose and are displayed 
in TeamCal Pro. You will have to leave them there if the language you are 
building bases on the same grammar and structure as English. If that is not the 
case play around with the values and see how it looks when you view TeamCal Pro 
with your file.

Where there are used white spaces (&nbsp;) it is important you use them too
if you have blanks in the string you wanna use. The white spaces avoid that
the browsers uses carriage returns.

You can switch languages by selecting one via the Language filter in the 
main menu of TeamCal Pro. You don't have to touch any PHP code to put your 
new language in that drop down box. As soon as a file of the naming 
convention <language>.tcpro.php resides in the includes/lang folder it will 
appear in the list.
