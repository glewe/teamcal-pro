TeamCal Pro is a legacy web application of a day-based calendar. It's generic purpose is the absence management of project teams, more precisely of their members.

The goal was to create an optically attractive but also effective representation of a calendar display, showing the presence and absence of each team member. TeamCal Pro supports the customization of holiday types and absence types, thus its purpose can be altered to any graphical representation of timeline based processes or activities, e.g. a simple project plan or an event management.
